## Ingredients

- 3kg beef cheeks
- 100ml olive oil
- 2 brown onions, chopped
- 1 whole head of garlic, split
- 2 carrots, chopped
- 1/4 bunch thyme
- 3 fresh bay leaves
- 1 cinnamon stick
- 2 star anise
- 1lt Pedro Ximenez sherry
- 500ml red wine

## Instructions

1. Heat oven to 200C. Clean sinew from beef cheeks, season with sea salt and place cheeks on a baking tray. Bake in oven for about 10 minutes each side. Remove when well browned.
2. In a heavy-based pot, heat olive oil and caramelise onion, garlic head and carrots. Add herbs and spices and cook for 3 minutes. Add sherry and wine, bring to the boil and simmer for 5 minutes.
3. Add browned cheeks, top up with 1 litre of water, cover with baking paper and a lid, then simmer for 3 hours or until tender. The cheeks should be tender but firm enough to stay intact. To test this, squeeze the cheek - if it's soft but doesn't fall apart, it's ready.
4. Remove cheeks from sauce and place in a small baking tray. Reduce sauce by half and pass through a sieve over cheeks.
5. Serve with [cauliflower puree](http://www.goodfood.com.au/good-food/cook/recipe/cauliflower-puree-20130715-2pzkp.html) - spoon some puree into the centre of a plate, place a cheek on the edge of the puree, then spoon a small amount of sauce over.
