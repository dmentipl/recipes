Hi, I'm [Daniel Mentiplay (@dmentipl)](https://dmentipl.github.io).

This is where I keep collections of recipes for food and drink (cocktails) to share with family, friends, and others. The recipes are mostly reworking of recipes I've found online or in books.

Some notes for cocktails:

1. My recipes use rich sugar syrup which is 2:1 sugar-to-water by volume, as opposed to simple syrup which is 1:1.
1. For the non-metric folk, 30 mL is approximately 1 fl oz.
