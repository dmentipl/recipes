Hi, I'm [Daniel Mentiplay](https://dmentipl.github.io) (@dmentipl). I love eating and cooking, and drinking and mixing drinks. I'm lucky to live in Melbourne, Australia where we have access to high quality ingredients *and* great restaurants and bars.

This is where I keep collections of recipes for [eating](eat) and [drinking](drink) to share with family, friends, and others. Feel free to [explore](explore). Some recipes I've reworked from recipes found online or in books. Other recipes I've created myself.

## Notes

Some notes for cocktails:

1. My recipes use rich sugar syrup which is 2:1 sugar-to-water by volume, as opposed to simple syrup which is 1:1.
1. For the non-metric folk, 30 mL is approximately 1 fl oz.
