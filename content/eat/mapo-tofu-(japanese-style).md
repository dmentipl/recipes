4. Cut the green onions into small pieces. Drain the tofu and cut into about 1 inch (2.5 cm) cubes.
5. In a large frying pan, heat vegetable oil on medium heat and saute garlic and ginger. Make sure you don't burn them. Once they are fragrant, add the ground pork and break it up with a spatula or wooden spoon.
