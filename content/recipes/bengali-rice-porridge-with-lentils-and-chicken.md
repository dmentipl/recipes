## Ingredients

- 3/4 cup jasmine rice
- 1 inch fresh turmeric or 1 teaspoon dried turmeric
- 1 inch fresh ginger
- 2 tablespoons butter or ghee
- 1/2 teaspoon Kashmiri red chilli powder
- 1/4 cup red lentils
- 6 cups (1.5 L) chicken stock
- 2 medium potato, peeled, 1 cm dice
- 400 g chicken thighs

*Coriander chutney*

- 1/2 bunch coriander, finely chopped
- 2 Thai green chiles, finely chopped
- 2 tablespoons (30 mL) lime juice
- 2 tablespoons (30 mL) olive oil

*To serve*

- Crispy fried onions or shallots, for garnish

## Instructions

1. Rinse rice with cold water until water runs clear. Cover rice with fresh cold water and set aside to soak.
2. Meanwhile, peel and grate turmeric (if using fresh) and ginger.
3. Drain rice and return to bowl. Gently crush with a muddler, rolling pin, or pestle, breaking rice into uneven pieces ranging from cornmeal-sized grains to larger pieces that are cracked or shattered in half.
4. In a large saucepan over medium heat, melt butter until foamy. Add turmeric, ginger, and red chile and cook until fragrant, about 2 minutes. Add rice, lentils, and chicken stock. Season with kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper. Bring to a boil, then reduce to a bare simmer. Simmer porridge, uncovered, until rice and lentils are tender, about 30 minutes.
5. Add potato and chicken thighs to porridge. Cook gently until potatoes are tender, chicken is cooked through, and porridge is thickened, about 30 minutes, stirring occasionally to prevent sticking.
6. Meanwhile, prepare the coriander chutney. In a small bowl, mix coriander and green chiles with lime juice and oil, then season with salt. Stir to combine.
7. Remove chicken from porridge and transfer to a cutting board. When cool enough to handle, dice chicken into 1 cm pieces and return to porridge. Adjust seasoning to taste with kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper, and add water if porridge becomes too thick.
8. Remove from heat and pour porridge into bowls. Garnish with coriander chutney and crispy fried shallots to taste.
